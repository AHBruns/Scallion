# Scallion

Scallion is an experimental program language currently being maintained and developed by a Alex Bruns. It's main features are syntactical richness. Unlike many languages which prioritize readability over information density, Scallion chooses to maximize info-per-character via some unique syntax. 

## Getting Started

## Acknowledgments

* I'd like to say thank you to Nick Hopper, my university professor. Nick, without your course, Advanced Programming Principles, I wouldn't have known where to begin with this project.
* Additionally, I owe a big thank you to all the people working on CPython. I tested all sorts of weird operator orderings in your repl.
